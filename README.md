can solve any differential equation from the followings

1. First order ODE
2. Higher Order ODE (converted to First Order)
3. Coupled ODE (Multiple equation at once)
4. Exponential Growth & Decay
5. Damped Harmonic Oscillator
6. Forced Oscillator (Resonance)
7. Chemical Reaction Kinetics
8. Logistic Growth Model

Limitations
1. No Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)
2. No Delay Differential Equations (DDEs)
3. No Algebraic Constraints (DAEs) Without Modifications
